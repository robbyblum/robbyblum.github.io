## Sparse sampling in multidimensional NMR

Half of my PhD work concerned finding ways to speed up time-consuming NMR experiments via clever usage of sparse sampling and signal reconstruction algorithms.

- “Reaching the sparse-sampling limit for reconstructing a single peak in a 2D NMR spectrum using iterated maps.” Robert L. Blum, Jared Rovny, J. Patrick Loria, and Sean E. Barrett, J. Biomol. NMR **73**, 545 (2019). DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-019-00262-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-019-00262-4)

## Discrete time crystals

The other half of my PhD work concerned investigating discrete time-crystalline signatures in an ordered crystal using NMR techniques.

- “Observation of Discrete-Time-Crystal Signatures in an Ordered Dipolar Many-Body System.” Jared Rovny, Robert L. Blum, and Sean E. Barrett, Phys. Rev. Lett. **120**, 180603 (2018). DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.120.180603](https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.120.180603)

- “31P NMR study of discrete time-crystalline signatures in an ordered crystal of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate.” Jared Rovny, Robert L. Blum, and Sean E. Barrett, Phys. Rev. B **97**, 184301 (2018). DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.97.184301](https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.97.184301)

## Blaseball analysis

In my spare time I've enjoyed studying the online video game Blaseball as part of the Society for Internet Blaseball Research, a group devoted to analyzing our favorite fictional online sport as seriously one would an actual real-life sport. In particular, I have been involved in two efforts that culminated in publishing a research paper on our findings.

- [Effect of the “Double Jumps” decree on playoff seeding](https://sibr.dev/papers/files/SIBR_Double_Jump_paper.pdf) (2020)

- [A sinking feeling: Investigating the relationship between team eDensity and Level](https://sibr.dev/papers/files/SIBR_eDensity2.pdf) (2021)
