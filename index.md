Hello and welcome to my **Personal Website**, which I have decided that I probably ought to have finally.

I did my Ph.D. in physics at Yale University, in Sean Barrett's lab. My graduate work focused on applications of solid-state NMR techniques to various novel questions. Further details are in my published work (see Publications).

I have been taking aerial circus classes for several years now. I have spent a lot of time on lyra, and am currently focusing on Chinese pole. I also am learning to juggle, because at some point everyone learning circus arts decides to learn to juggle as well. It's fun! I'm not very good at it yet! I don't have much of anything about this online right now, but if I ever put together a performance I'll link it on here.

I also love sports and sports statistics, as well as video games; the combination of these has led me to be involved in statistical and other mathematical analysis of the online fake sport video game Blaseball as part of the [Society for Internet Blaseball Research](https://sibr.dev) (SIBR). I also am involved in the Splatoon 3 competitive scene, both as a player and as a tournament organizer with [Inkling Performance Labs](https://iplabs.ink) (IPL). Naturally, I have also gravitated toward analysis projects for Splatoon when I get the chance.


## Code Projects

### Academic repositories

- [DiffMap/coDiffMap python code](https://github.com/robbyblum/DiffMap-coDiffMap-Python): Python implementation of the signal reconstruction methods developed in my Ph.D. work.
- [Ph.D. dissertation template](https://github.com/robbyblum/yale_phd_thesis_template): The search for the One True Dissertation Template is neverending, but here is my contribution. Hopefully it helps some graduate student in the future searching Google for a good LaTeX template.

### Hobby repositories

- [DS18B20 Temperature Logger for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/robbyblum/DS18B20-TemperatureLogger): Home temperature logger, which hasn't been online since I last moved. Did a good job of showing how much heat my old apartment lost through its massive windows.
- [Resim](https://github.com/xSke/resim): Reverse-engineering blaseball, my favorite fake online sport, from the PRNG stream. I contribute to this project as part of the [Society for Internet Blaseball Research](https://sibr.dev). Much of my work is using support vector classification fits to figure out the original formulas for things like "is this pitch in the strike zone" or "does this runner attempt to steal the next base" or "does an umpire incinerate a player on this game tick, and if so, who."
- Blaseball notebooks ([repository](https://github.com/robbyblum/blaseball_notebooks), [website](https://robbyblum.github.io/blaseball_notebooks/)): Jupyter notebooks for Blaseball election analysis, etc. The analysis is for the strategic benefit of the Baltimore Crabs, but the methods are open for all to benefit (in fact, I forked this from [Edgarware's project](https://edgarware.github.io/blaseball_notebooks/), which he did for the Philly Pies).

## Project Posts

I have done several small analysis projects that I don't have on GitHub, but have written up the results either here or elsewhere:

- [Linear modeling in Blaseball](https://sibr.dev/blog/basic-linear-modeling/): Post I made on the SIBR blog during the short-lived Return of Blaseball in early 2023. Shows what you can learn from a season's worth of statistics and some basic linear modeling.
- [Tiebreaker format comparisons: Battlefy vs. Sendou](./tiebreakers.html): Analysis I did for IPL after we migrated platforms for our largest tournament in December 2024, illustrating the difference in the tiebreaker methods our old and new platforms used for the Swiss tournament format. As a result of this analysis, Sendou updated to use tiebreakers that are much closer to Battlefy's method, which we think work pretty well.
