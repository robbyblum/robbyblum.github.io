Hello and welcome to my **Personal Website**, which I have decided that I probably ought to have finally.

I did my Ph.D. in physics at Yale University, in Sean Barrett's lab. My graduate work focused on applications of solid-state NMR techniques to various novel questions. Further details are in my published work (see Publications).

I have been taking aerial circus classes for a few years now. I have spent a lot of time on lyra, and am currently focusing on Chinese pole. I also am learning to juggle, because at some point everyone learning circus arts decides to learn to juggle as well. It's fun! I'm not very good at it yet! I don't have much of anything about this online right now, but if I ever put together a performance I'll link it on here.

I also love sports and sports statistics, as well as video games; the combination of these has led me to be involved in statistical and other mathematical analysis of the online fake sport video game Blaseball (more details in Projects and Publications).
